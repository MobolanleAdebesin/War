# War
"War" is a card game in which two players split a deck of 52 cards. Neither player can look at their hand, instead they must flip the top most card at the same time. Whichever player has the higher card wins the round and takes both the cards in play. Sound simple, but beware! If both players play cards of equal value, war ensues!
